# Movie Explorer

React Native application that allows users to explore and view movie details. The app uses the TMDB API for fetching movie data.

This was my first time developing an application in React Native, and in such a short space of time. However, I did my best.

There are different ways to run the app in your device or emulator but you can follow the approach recommended bellow.

## Requirements

* Node.js > 12 and npm 
* JDK > 11
* Android Studio and Android SDK
* New TMDB API Key or Token if the hardcoded is not valid anymore

## Usage

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run android 
```

```bash
npm run ios
```
